 * Mid-conversation agent handoff: the frontend half of `acp::handoff`.

 * earlier segment in front of the new session and marks the seam with a tool
 * call tagged `_meta["codeg.handoff"]` (same shape as the context-compaction
 * divider). Recognition is by `_meta` key, never by agent or tool name, so the
 * card renders for history reads and live snapshots alike.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free, like `context-compaction.ts`, so the grouping pass in
 * the adapter and the card can share it without an import cycle.
