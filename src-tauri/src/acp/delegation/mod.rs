//! Multi-agent delegation: the parent agent's LLM can call the built-in MCP
//! tool `delegate_to_agent` to spawn a fresh ACP session of any (possibly
//! different) agent type, wait for its first turn to finish, and receive the
//! sub-agent's final assistant text as the MCP tool_result.
//!
//! The high-level wiring is:
//!
//! ```text
//!   parent LLM ─┐
//!               │ ToolUse(delegate_to_agent, ...)
//!               ▼
//!   parent CLI ──stdio──► codeg-mcp (per-launch companion binary)
//!                                 │
//!                                 │ UDS / named pipe (token-authed)
//!                                 ▼
//!                       DelegationBroker (this module)
//!                                 │
//!                                 │ ConnectionSpawner trait
//!                                 ▼
//!                       ConnectionManager.spawn_agent / send_prompt_linked
//!                                 │
//!                                 ▼
//!                       child ACP session  ── TurnComplete ──┐
//!                                                            │
//!   parent LLM ◄── MCP tool_result ◄── DelegationOutcome ◄───┘
//! ```
//!
//! v1 is one-shot (function-call semantics): after the child's first
//! `TurnComplete`, the broker resolves the pending call, sends `disconnect`
//! to the child, and returns. v2 will introduce `continue_with_session` /
//! `close_session` tools without protocol breakage.
