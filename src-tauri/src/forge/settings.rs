//! Preferences for the Issues/PR panel: what the trigger dialog opens with,
//! and the standing instructions every task it mints carries.
//!
//! **Scoped exactly like the task settings.** There is one global row plus an
//! optional per-folder override, and an override wins WHOLESALE — saving one
//! detaches that folder from the global row entirely rather than merging field
//! by field. The rule is copied deliberately: the two dialogs sit one click
//! apart on the same workbench, and a user who has learned "this folder has its
//! own settings now" in one of them must not meet different arithmetic in the
//! other.
//!
//! What it does NOT replace is the folder's `stage_prompts` in the task
//! settings, which forge tasks receive at launch like any other work task (see
//! `engine::stage_prompt_block`). That covers a stage of a task's life; this
//! covers a KIND of work item — how an issue should be handled as opposed to a
//! review, which is a distinction the task engine has no word for.
//!
//! Stored as ONE JSON blob in `app_metadata` — the global row and every
//! override together — rather than a row per scope. The whole thing is read
//! once per page load and once per trigger, and a save is a read-modify-write
//! of a single scope, so no save ever rewrites another scope's values.
