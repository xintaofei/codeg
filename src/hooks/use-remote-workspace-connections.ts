/**
 * Shared state + actions behind every "Open remote workspace" menu (the status
 * bar's quick-actions submenu, the sidebar list's context menu). Each of them
 * renders its own markup — one is a dropdown, one a context menu — but the
 * loading, the opening and the two failure toasts are identical, so they live
 * here instead of being copy-pasted per surface.
 *
 * `refresh` is deliberately NOT called on mount: connections are only needed
 * once a submenu actually opens, and these menus are mounted for the whole
 * session. Callers wire it to their submenu's `onOpenChange`.
 *
 * `desktop` is re-exported so callers can hide their entry entirely: a web
 * client can't spawn another window bound to a different server.
