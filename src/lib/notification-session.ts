/**
 * Which session an OS notification is about, in words a user recognises.
 *
 * A notification used to be titled with the window's ACTIVE folder — not the
 * folder of the session that raised it — and to name only the agent, so with
 * several sessions running an "<agent> needs permission" notification pointed
 * at none of them in particular, and could name the wrong folder outright.
 *
 * The connection's context key is its tab id. From the tab we reach the
 * persisted conversation (its title, its own folder), falling back to the
 * tab's label for a draft that has no row yet. A key no tab owns — a canvas
 * card, a delegated sub-agent's own connection — keeps the old active-folder
 * title.
