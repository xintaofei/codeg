 *   untrue) → an `image` block.
 * - Agents that reject image content but accept embedded context
 *   (`caps.embedded_context`) → an embedded `resource` blob carrying the same
 *   base64 bytes and image mime type.
 *
 * The capability is a single bit, so this cannot vary the encoding per mime
 * type. An agent that takes native images but decodes only some formats is
 * sorted out at dispatch instead, where the whole prompt is in view — see
 * `normalize_grok_image_blocks` in `acp/connection.rs`.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: a path-less pasted image (no `uri`) is given a stable
 * `clipboard://` identifier derived from its name + id, so the emitted block is
 * reproducible without a random source (and unit-testable).
